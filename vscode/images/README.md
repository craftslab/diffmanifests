# Icon Placeholder

The extension icon should be placed here as `icon.png`.

Recommended specifications:
- Size: 128x128 pixels
- Format: PNG
- Background: Transparent or solid color
- Design: Simple, recognizable icon representing manifest comparison

You can create an icon using:
- Image editing software (Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)
- Online icon generators
- Vector graphics tools (Illustrator, Inkscape)

Suggested design elements:
- Two documents side by side
- Diff symbols (-, +, ~)
- Magnifying glass over XML/code
- Comparison arrows

For now, the extension will work without an icon, but having one is recommended for publishing to the marketplace.
